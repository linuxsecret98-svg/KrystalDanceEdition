## <p align="center">🔧 Uhhhhhh Reanimate — Upgraded by MRXH</p>
<p align="center">Unofficial patch & upgrade by <b>@Ghost (mrghost / MRXH)</b> on top of STEVE's original build.</p>

### Changelog

#### v1.0.9 — MRXH Patch
> Base: `reanimate.lua` v1.0.9 (STEVE original)

**Changes made:**

1. **Removed `BETA` label from version string**
   - `UhhhhhhVersion` changed from `"1.0.9 BETA"` to `"1.0.9"`
   - Applies automatically everywhere the version is displayed (TopBar, Cracktro, char name, etc.)

2. **Upgrade: Force-stop all game animations while reanimate is active**

   Previous issue: built-in game animations (idle, walk, etc.) could still override the reanimate pose server-side, causing the reanimate to not be visible to other players.

   **Fix applied at 4 different points:**

   - **`LimbReanimator` → `CharOnDesc`** — Whenever a new Animator appears on the character, all currently playing `AnimationTrack`s are immediately `Stop(0)`'d before the Animator is destroyed.

   - **`LimbReanimator` → `CharacterAdded`** — On character spawn, all tracks are stopped via the Animator *and* via the Humanoid directly (fallback). A **persistent killer loop** on `RunService.PreAnimation` runs every frame to ensure no new animations can be replayed by the game.

   - **`HatReanimator` → `CharOnDesc`** — Same as LimbReanimator: stops all tracks before destroying any newly added Animator.

   - **`HatReanimator` → `OnCharacter` (NoAnim block)** — Stops via Animator + Humanoid fallback before destroying.

   > **Why `Stop(0)`?** It stops animations instantly with no fade-out. The default `Stop()` has a 0.1s blend-out which can still be seen server-side.

## Loadstring

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxsecret98-svg/uhhhhh-reanimate-upgrade/refs/heads/main/source/reanimate.lua"))()
```

## Features:
1. ~Probably the most stable hatdrop~ (roblox patched permadeath which makes this useless 3:)

   Uhhhhhh's hatdrop supports most (if not all) hat rigs!

2. Limb reanimation support

   In the case where you are just unable to afford hats, you can use your own limbs instead!

   Unfortunately, this only supports a few games.

3. Good looking UI

   definitely better than genesis

4. Moveset and Dance system

   Have old animations, or become Lightning Cannon. Dance anytime!

5. Takes advantage of random replicate properties

   Serversided Physics glue = very accurate (and fast) fling!

6. Modding support

   Infinite Yield lets you make plugins. So why not add it to Uhhhhhh too?

   The documentation is right below all of whatever these are.

7. Themes

   You hate the colors? Change them! Do you want black? Do you want white? Do you want your own? The choice is yours.

```lua
-- example theme
_G.UhhhhhhTheme = {
	Fore = Color3.new(0, 1, 0), -- nil = rainbow
	Back = Color3.new(0, 0, 0), -- nil = pure black
	Text = Color3.new(0, 1, 0),
}
-- the Color3s can also be a hex code string e.g.: "DDBB69"
```

## Contributing

"Can I help? Can I/you add support for my hat?""

If you want to help by changing code, fixing bugs, doing further optimisations, my pull requests are open.

As for me adding support for your hats (since the hat database is very small), create an issue and ill prolly read it.

# Uhhhhhh's probably the most important quotes
**DISCLAIMER**: Some random quotes made here are *simple jokes* (e.g.: "this script mogs genesis") and should **not** be taken seriously. This also includes *all* the self-glazing quotes. **It's your choice to agree with them or not**, and if you do or don't, **don't come harass/mock any individuals from it.** In the end, a *joke quote* is a *joke quote*.

## Filesystem structure
Uhhhhhh's filesystem is like this
```txt
Executor's workspace/
| UhhhhhhReanim/
| | Assets/ - Contains UI Music
| | Modules/ - YOUR modules
| | Content/ - Contains module assets
| | | Anims/ - .anim (usually in STEVE's KeyframeSequence file format)
| | | Sounds/ - .mp3
| | | Images/ - .png
| | | Models/ - .rbxm
| | | Unknown/ - Ungrouped assets
| | tree.ehehetilde - All save data in JSON
| | .nomedia - Created for android users
```

## Modules
Modules are just luau tables that are created by a function.
It does impose vulnerabilities, but who cares? Executors already
execute functions from user strings.

Modules are returned by a function from a luau script.
honestly idk how to document this in an understandable way so
heres an example, with code comments:
```lua
-- UhhhhhhReanim/Modules/lazy.lua

local modules = {} -- table to contain all modules

-- function called to create the module
-- this allows for local variables
table.insert(modules, function() -- put into modules table
	local m = {} -- module object
	
	-- can be "MOVESET" or "DANCE"
	m.ModuleType = "DANCE"
	
	-- name of module
	m.Name = "Lazy"
	
	-- description of module
	m.Description = "too lazy to even animate"
	
	-- internal name, used for movesets and dances to interact with each other
	-- best usage example of this is Immortality Lord + ragdoll
	-- this can be omitted
	m.InternalName = "DANCE_LAZY"
	
	-- table of assets to download, either in "filename" or "filename@url_to_source"
	m.Assets = {"Lazy.mp3@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/69.mp3"}
	
	-- functions below should NOT yield
	
	-- configuration GUI function, recommended to use these:
	-- Util_CreateText(parent, text, fontsize, alignment)
	-- Util_CreateButton(parent, text, fontsize)
	-- Util_CreateSwitch(parent, text, is_on)
	-- Util_CreateTextbox(parent, text, placeholdertext, fontsize)
	-- Util_CreateSlider(parent, text, value, min, max, step)
	-- Util_CreateDropdown(parent, text, items, itemindex)
	-- Util_CreateCanvas(parent)
	-- Util_CreateScrollCanvas(parent, height)
	-- Util_CreateSeparator(parent)
	m.Config = function(parent: GuiBase2d)
		Util_CreateText(parent, "hi", 67, Enum.TextXAlignment.Center)
	end
	
	-- function called to load from save table
	-- this function can be omitted
	m.LoadConfig = function(save: any)
	end
	
	-- function called to save from load table
	-- this function can be omitted
	m.SaveConfig = function()
		return {} -- AND KEEP YOUR TABLES SERIALIZABLE
	end
	
	-- called upon initialization
	m.Init = function(figure: Model)
		-- access upvalues, initialize animator
	end
	
	-- called upon update loop
	m.Update = function(dt: number, figure: Model)
		local t = tick()
		-- step the animator, emit particles
	end
	
	-- called upon destruction
	-- this is not called when figure is refreshed so reference ur created and modified instances
	m.Destroy = function(figure: Model?)
		-- destroy created instances, dereference animator
	end
	return m -- function returns the module
end)

return modules -- return modules
```

## STEVE's KeyframeSequence file format
It's all pretty simple, really.
The byteorder is in little endian.

string structure: `<2 bytes short n> <n bytes string>`

pose structure: `<string pose_name> <4 bytes float weight> <string pose_easing_style> <string pose_easing_direction> <4 bytes float cframe component, times 12>`

keyframe structure: `<4 bytes float time> <4 bytes int n> <pose poses, times n>`

main file structure: `<string animation_name> <4 bytes int n> <keyframe keyframes, times n>`

This just explains how this format works. If you don't like it, check the `tools` folder in this repo!

## Uhhhhhh's env
Uhhhhhh gives modules whatever it can. Here are all of it!

HiddenGui -- the reference to the ScreenGui Uhhhhhh uses
FallenPartsDestroyHeight -- self explanatory
```

## "i dont understand all this"
That's why I have made (in v1.0.3) the stuff that gives Empyrean Reanimate (emper chill lowkirkenuinly) the ability to be used in require script convertions!
`_G.Uhhhhhh` which contains `.Character` and `.Fling`, but using this might make you rejoin just to stop everything...

So I also made `goodies/convertion.lua`! For all those smarty-pants out there, you may now make your own "moveset" with a couple of changes to the actual source!
Link your connection disconnections, thread stoppers and instance deconstructions to a singular `OnStopEvent` `BindableEvent`, NOW!
(not doing so will cause havoc in your threads ;P)
